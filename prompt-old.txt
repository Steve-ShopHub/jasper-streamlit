full_prompt_text = """**Task:**
Your primary task is to meticulously analyse the attached facility agreement document. You MUST answer **every single question** listed below for the specified section. Prioritise accuracy and direct evidence from the text.

**Output Requirements:**
Generate a **single JSON array** as output, strictly adhering to the provided schema. Each object within the array MUST correspond to one question from the filtered list below. Ensure all **required** properties (`Question Number`, `Question Category`, `Question`, `Answer`, `Clause Reference`, `Clause Wording`, `Answer Justification`) are present in every object.

*   **Completeness:** Ensure an object is generated for **every question** in the filtered list, even conditional ones.
*   **Question Number:** Populate the 'Question Number' field with the corresponding number from the original list (1 to 78).
*   **Answers:** Populate the 'Answer' field based on your analysis.
    *   For questions with 'Answer Options', your 'Answer' **MUST** contain one of the provided options exactly as written (unless the option indicates free text like 'BLANK', 'Text', 'Date', in which case provide the specific text/date found).
    *   For 'Multiselect' options, list all applicable options separated by commas.
    *   If the document does not contain the information to answer a question, state 'Information Not Found' in the 'Answer' field.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Populate the 'Clause Reference' field with the specific clause number(s) or section(s) referenced (e.g., 'Clause 14.1(a)', 'Section 5'). If no specific clause provides the answer, state 'N/A'.
    *   Populate the 'Clause Wording' field with the **exact, full text** of the referenced clause(s) or relevant sentence(s). If 'Clause Reference' is 'N/A', this should also be 'N/A'.
*   **Justification:** Populate the 'Answer Justification' field to briefly explain *why* the referenced clause and wording support the given 'Answer', especially if it's not immediately obvious. If the answer is 'Information Not Found' or 'N/A', explain briefly why (e.g., "Condition not met", "Term not defined in document").
*   **Conditional Questions:** For questions with bracketed conditions (e.g., '[If yes...]'), if the condition is **not met** based on the answer to the preceding question *within the current section*, you MUST still include the question object in the JSON array. In such cases, set the 'Answer', 'Clause Reference', 'Clause Wording', and 'Answer Justification' fields to 'N/A - Condition Not Met'. Ensure the 'Question Number' field is still populated correctly.
